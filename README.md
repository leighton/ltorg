ltorg
=====

This is the source code for my personal site - http://leightonturner.org

The site is a simple contact information website with a twist. Namely, a
daemon that runs on my PC broadcasts my CPU usage to every browser client
viewing the site. Furthermore, I can broadcast a single one line message 
to every browser client from my terminal. The cpu daemon and activity
broadcasting code is here [ltorg-client](https://github.com/leighton/ltorg-client).

For this to work you need a free pusher.com account.
